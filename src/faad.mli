(** Close a decoder. *)

(** [init dec buf ofs len]Â initializes a decoder given the [len] bytes of data
  * in [buf] starting at offset [ofs]. It returns the offset (number of bytes to
  * skip), the samplerate and the number of channels of the stream. This function
  * should be used for AAC data. For MP4 files, [init2] should be used instead.

val init : t -> string -> int -> int -> int * int * int

(** Same as [init] but for MP4 files. Returns the samplerate and the number of
  * channels. *)
val init2 : t -> string -> int -> int -> int * int

(** [decode dec buf ofs len]Â decodes at most [len] bytes of data in [buf]
  * starting at offset [ofs]. It returns the number of bytes actually decoded
  * and the decoded data (non-interleaved).
